A nice little python package for doing message-based protocols and abstracting away all the messy bits.

Originally built in order to abstract some of the networking layer when building an implementation of the minecraft for my YATE project.

Dependencies:
 * eventlet (and therefore greenlet)
 * dnslib if running the dns_server.py example https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dnslib
