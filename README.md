This repo contains some nice tools for writing networking applications in Python that require a message based protocol.

To use it, copy base_sock.py and the other relevant file into your own project, and make sure to obey the GPL or I will have such revenges upon you that they shall be the terrors of the earth.

This code also requires eventlet to be installed, which itself requires greenlet
